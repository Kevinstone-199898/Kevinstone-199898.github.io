## Basketball & Fitness workouts

I love playing basketball and doing finess training in my spare time. I dreamed of dunking for several years and was very close to achieve that. Sadly, I didn't realise my dream due to several reasons. Maybe in the future, I could have chance to do it……

## Movies & Books

I also love watching movies and reading books especially biographies of scientists and entrepreneurs. It is also my dream to become a great scientist and entrepreneur in the future.
